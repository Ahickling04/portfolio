                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a student software engineer studying at Blackpool and the Fylde University. I'd say that I've always had an interest in technology, both software and hardware, however it was my passion for games that made me wish to pursue a career in software development. <br>
I've been coding on and off since I was 17, starting off with little projects in godot that I've lost but as I've gotten older and developed more of an understanding of how technology works, and a really strong interest in Linux and Open-Source software, I've gained more knowledge and started with a strong project, the Open Source Music Player. However, I began to study software engineering to not only aid in my knowledge of the field but also to help gain some qualifications within it as well.
